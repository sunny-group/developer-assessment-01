# The 8 Queens

Write a program which uses an iterative backtracking method to solve the 8 queens problem.

Your program should print the columns in which each queen should be placed on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queen attacks any other.

A queen can attack another if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal.
