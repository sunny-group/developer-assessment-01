# The 8 Queens

Write a program which uses an iterative backtracking method to solve the 8 queens problem.

Your program should print the columns in which each queen should be placed on an 8x8 chessboard so that no queen attacks any other.

A queen can attack another if it is in the same row, column, or diagonal.

### Bonus Question

If you are up to it, and have enough time remaining, you can take on the following bonus question.

An array **A[1..n]** contains n distinct integers in arbitrary order. Write a function **kthSmall** of order O(n) which, when called with **kthSmall(A, k, 1, n)**, returns the kth smallest integer in the array **A**. You may assume that a function **partition** is available which, when called with **partition(A, lo, hi)** rearranges the numbers **A[lo]** to **A[hi]** and returns a value **d** such that **A[i]** < **A[d]** < **A[j]** for **lo** <= **i** < **d** < **j** <= **hi**.
